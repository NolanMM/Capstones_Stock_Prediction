## Real-Time Stock Prediction and Financial Analytics Platform

---

### I. Introduction
This project is designed to develop a sophisticated and comprehensive application that harnesses the power of deep learning to predict stock prices with a high degree of accuracy. The application will serve as an all-in-one financial platform, offering users access to critical financial data, real-time market updates, curated news, and interactive visualizations for selected stocks. By integrating advanced machine learning algorithms, the system will analyze historical stock data, identify patterns, and generate predictive insights to assist users in forecasting future price movements.
